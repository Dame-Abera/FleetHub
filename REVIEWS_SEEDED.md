## How It Works:

When you seed the database, all reviews will be automatically created for all cars. Each car will have 2-3 reviews that will display when users view the car details.

---

## Next Steps:

1. **Deploy the updated seed file** (already done in code)
2. **Reseed your database**:
   ```bash
   # In Render Shell or locally:
   cd Backend
   npx prisma db seed
   ```
   
   Or if the database is already seeded, you might want to reset first:
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate reset
   # This will reset DB and run seed automatically
   ```

---

## ✅ Result:

After seeding, **every car will have reviews** that users can see when browsing cars! The reviews make the marketplace look more authentic and trustworthy. 🚗✨
